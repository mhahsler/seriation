\strong{Criteria for distance matrices (dist)}

For a symmetric dissimilarity matrix \eqn{D} with elements \eqn{d(i,j)}
where \eqn{i, j = 1 \ldots n}, the aim is generally to place low distance
values close to the diagonal. The following criteria to judge the quality of
a certain permutation of the objects in a dissimilarity matrix are currently
implemented (for a more detailed description and an experimental comparison
see Hahsler (2017)):
\itemize{
\item \strong{Gradient measures:} \code{"Gradient_raw"}, \code{"Gradient_weighted"} (Hubert et al, 2001)

A symmetric dissimilarity matrix where the values in
all rows and columns only increase when moving away from the main diagonal
is called a perfect \emph{anti-Robinson matrix} (Robinson 1951). A suitable
merit measure which quantifies the divergence of a matrix from the
anti-Robinson form is
\deqn{ M(D) = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{i<k<j} f(d_{ij}, d_{ik}) + \sum_{i<k<j}
    f(d_{ij}, d_{kj})} where \eqn{f(.,.)} is a function which defines how a
violation or satisfaction of a gradient condition for an object triple
(\eqn{O_i, O_k, O_j}) is counted.

Hubert et al (2001) suggest two functions. The first function is given by:
\deqn{f(z,y) = sign(y-z) = +1 \ \text{if}\ z < y;\ 0\ \text{if}\ z = y; \ \text{and}\ -1 \ \text{if}\ z > y.}

It results in raw number of triples satisfying the gradient constraints
minus triples which violate the constraints.

The second function is defined as: \deqn{f(z,y) = |y-z| sign(y-z) = y-z} It
weights the each satisfaction or violation by the difference by its
magnitude given by the absolute difference between the values.
\item \strong{Anti-Robinson events:} \code{"AR_events"}, \code{"AR_deviations"} (Chen, 2002)

\code{"AR_events"} counts the number of violations of the anti-Robinson form.
\deqn{ L(D) = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{i<k<j} f(d_{ik}, d_{ij}) + \sum_{i<k<j} f(d_{kj}, d_{ij})}

with
\deqn{ f(z, y) = I(z, y) = 1 \ \text{if}\  z < y\ \text{and}\ 0 \ \text{otherwise,}}

where \eqn{I(.)} is an indicator function returning 1 only for violations.
Chen (2002) presented a formulation for an equivalent loss function and
called the violations \emph{anti-Robinson events.}

\code{"AR_deviations"}: Chen (2002) also introduced a
weighted versions of the loss function by using
\deqn{ f(z, y) = |y-z|I(z, y) } which weights each violation by
the deviation.
\item \strong{Relative generalized Anti-Robinson events:} \code{"RGAR"}  (Tien et al, 2008)

Counts Anti-Robinson events in a variable band (window specified
by \code{w} defaults to the maximum of \eqn{n-1}) around the main diagonal
and normalizes by the maximum of possible events.

\deqn{ L(D) = 1/m \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{(i-w)\le j<k<i} I(d_{ij} < d_{ik}) +
    \sum_{i<j<k\le(i+w))} I(d_{ij} > d_{ik}) }

where \eqn{m=(2/3-n)w + nw^2 - 2/3 w^3}, the maximal number of possible
anti-Robinson events in the window.  The window size \eqn{w} represents the
number of neighboring objects (number of entries from the diagonal of the
distance matrix) are considered. The window size is \eqn{2 \le w < n}, where
smaller values result in focusing on the local structure while larger values
look at the global structure.

\code{...} parameters are:
\itemize{
\item \code{w} window size. Default is to use a \code{pct} of 100\% of \eqn{n}.
\item \code{pct} and alternative specification of w as a percentage of \eqn{n} in \eqn{(0, 100]}.
\item \code{relative} logical; can be set to \code{FALSE} to get the GAR, i.e., the absolute number of AR
events in the window.
}
\item \strong{Banded anti-Robinson form criterion:} \code{"BAR"}  (Earle and Hurley, 2015)

Simplified measure for closeness to the anti-Robinson form in a band of size
\eqn{b} with \eqn{1 <= b < n} around the diagonal.

\deqn{ L(D) = \sum_{|i-j|<=b} (b+1-|i-j|) d_{ij} }

For \eqn{b = 1} the measure reduces to the Hamiltonian path length.  For
\eqn{b = n-1} the measure is equivalent to ARc defined
(see \code{\link[=register_DendSer]{register_DendSer()}}).

\code{...} parameter is: \code{b} band size defaults to a band of 20\% of \eqn{n}.
\item \strong{Hamiltonian path length:} \code{"Path_length"}  (Caraux and Pinloche, 2005)

The order of the objects in a dissimilarity matrix corresponds to a path
through a graph where each node represents an object and is visited exactly
once, i.e., a Hamilton path. The length of the path is defined as the sum of
the edge weights, i.e., dissimilarities.

\deqn{L(D) = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} d_{i,i+1}}

The length of the Hamiltonian path is equal to the value of the minimal span
loss function (as used by Chen 2002).  Both notions are related to the
\emph{traveling salesperson problem (TSP).}

If \code{order} is not unique or there are non-finite distance values
\code{NA} is returned.
\item \strong{Lazy path length:} \code{"Lazy_path_length"} (Earl and Hurley, 2015)

A weighted version of the Hamiltonian path criterion. This loss function
postpones larger distances to later in the order (i.e., a lazy traveling
sales person).

\deqn{L(D) = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (n-i) d_{i,i+1}}

Earl and Hurley (2015) proposed this criterion for reordering in
visualizations to concentrate on closer objects first.
\item \strong{Inertia criterion:} \code{"Inertia"}  (Caraux and Pinloche, 2005)

Measures the moment of the inertia of dissimilarity values around the
diagonal as

\deqn{M(D) = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n d(i,j)|i-j|^2}

\eqn{|i-j|} is used as a measure for the distance to the diagonal and
\eqn{d(i,j)} gives the weight. This criterion gives higher weight to values
farther away from the diagonal. It increases with quality.
\item \strong{Least squares criterion:} \code{"Least_squares"} (Caraux and Pinloche, 2005)

The sum of squared differences between distances and the rank differences:
\deqn{L(D) = \sum_{i=1}^n
  \sum_{j=1}^n (d(i,j) - |i-j|)^2,} where \eqn{d(i,j)} is an element of the
dissimilarity matrix \eqn{D} and \eqn{|i-j|} is the rank difference between
the objects.

Note that if Euclidean distance is used to calculate \eqn{D} from a data
matrix \eqn{X}, the order of the elements in \eqn{X} by projecting them on
the first principal component of \eqn{X} minimizes this criterion.  The
least squares criterion is related to \emph{unidimensional scaling.}
\item \strong{Linear Seriation Criterion:} \code{"LS"}  (Hubert and Schultz, 1976)

Weights the distances with the absolute rank differences.

\deqn{L(D) \sum_{i,j=1}^n d(i,j) |i-j|}
\item \strong{2-Sum Criterion:} \code{"2SUM"}  (Barnard, Pothen and Simon, 1993)

The 2-Sum loss criterion multiplies the similarity between objects with the
squared rank differences.

\deqn{L(D) \sum_{i,j=1}^n 1/(1+d(i,j)) (i-j)^2,}

where \eqn{s(i,j) = 1/(1+d(i,j))} represents the similarity between objects
\eqn{i} and \eqn{j}.
\item \strong{Absolute Spearman Correlation} \code{"Rho"}

The absolute value of the Spearman rank correlation
between the original distances and the rank differences in the order.
\item \strong{Matrix measures:} \code{"ME"}, \code{"Moore_stress"}, \code{"Neumann_stress"}

These criteria are defined on general matrices (see
below for definitions).  The dissimilarity matrix is first converted into a
similarity matrix using \eqn{S = 1/(1+D)}. If a different transformation is
required, then perform the transformation first and supply a matrix instead
of a dist object.
}

\strong{Criteria for matrices (matrix)}

For a general matrix \eqn{X = x_{ij}}, \eqn{i = 1 \ldots n} and
\eqn{j = 1 \ldots m}, currently the following loss/merit functions are implemented:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Measure of Effectiveness:} \code{"ME"}  (McCormick, 1972).

The measure of effectiveness (ME) for matrix \eqn{X}, is defined as

\deqn{M(X) = 1/2 \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{m}
    x_{i,j}(x_{i,j-1}+x_{i,j+1}+x_{i-1,j}+x_{i+1,j})}

with, by convention

\deqn{x_{0,j}=x_{m+1,j}=x_{i,0}=x_{i,n+1}=0.}

ME is a merit measure, i.e. a higher ME indicates a better arrangement.
Maximizing ME is the objective of the bond energy algorithm (BEA). ME is not
defined for matrices with negative values. \code{NA} is returned in this
case.
\item \strong{Weighted correlation coefficient:} \code{"Cor_R"}  (Deutsch and Martin, 1971)

Developed as the Measure of Effectiveness for the Moment
Ordering Algorithm.
R is a merit measure normalized so that its value always lies in
\eqn{[-1,1]}.  For the special case of a square matrix \eqn{R=1} corresponds
to only the main diagonal being filled, \eqn{R=0} to a random distribution
of value throughout the array, and \eqn{R=-1} to the opposite diagonal only
being filled.
\item \strong{Matrix Stress:} \code{"Moore_stress"}, \code{"Neumann_stress"}  (Niermann, 2005)

Stress measures the conciseness of the presentation of a matrix/table and
can be seen as a purity function which compares the values in a matrix/table
with its neighbors. The stress measure used here is computed as the sum of
squared distances of each matrix entry from its adjacent entries.

\deqn{ L(X) = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^m \sigma_{ij} }

The following types of neighborhoods are available:
\itemize{
\item Moore: comprises the eight adjacent entries.
\deqn{
     \sigma_{ij} = \sum_{k=\max(1,i-1)}^{\min(n,i+1)}
     \sum_{l=\max(1,j-1)}^{\min(m,j+1)} (x_{ij} - x_{kl})^2 }
\item Neumann: comprises the four adjacent entries.  \deqn{ \sigma_{ij} =
     \sum_{k=\max(1,i-1)}^{\min(n,i+1)} (x_{ij} - x_{kj})^2 +
     \sum_{l=\max(1,j-1)}^{\min(m,j+1)} (x_{ij} - x_{il})^2 }
}

The major difference between the Moore and the Neumann neighborhood is that
for the later the contribution of row and column permutations to stress are
independent and thus can be optimized independently.
